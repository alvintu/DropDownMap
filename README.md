#Drop Down Map

Basic map animation drop down on the root view controller. Nothing too innovative.

I really enjoyed building and using this in my app so I decided to share this small snippet.


The animation code that drops down the map can be altered to levitate and lock up to the top of the screen,instead of drop down, if you change the coordinates put opposite y values.


Cheers!
